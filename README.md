# ChessAIJulia

A university project for programming an AI for Chess using Julia

## Contents

### /Julia

This directory contains all the Jupyter Notebooks written in Julia needed for the AI.

| Notebook                | Function                                                                                     |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| AlphaBetaPruning.ipynb  | **AI** that calculates a move using the Alpha-Beta-Pruning algorithm                         |
| ChessJL Summary.ipynb   | A summary of the most important methods that Chess.jl provides                               |
| EvaluatePosition.ipynb  | Evaluation a chess position refers how strong the position or one move is                    |
| IterativeDeepening.ipynb| **AI** that calculates a move using iterative deepening with the alpha-beta-pruning algorithm|
| Minimax.ipynb           | **AI** that calculates a move using the minimax algorithm                                    |
| PGN_Export_.ipynb       | Export games as PGN files                                                                    |
| PGN_Import_.ipynb       | Import PGN files as Games                                                                    |
| Play.ipynb              | **Play** as a user against one of the chess                                                  |
| Random Chess.ipynb      | **AI** that plays a random move out of a List of all possible moves using a seed             |
| ValidateUserInput.ipynb | Check is the user input in legal moves                                                       |
| style.css               | Contains some css for using the whole width of a notebook                                    |

The notebooks ending on `[notebook]_testing.ipynb` are tests for the corresponding notebook.

### /Games
This directory contains PGN (Portable Game Notation) files of chess games played against written AIs in the `Play.ipynb`. They will be saved to later on find errors to see how the chess AIs behaved.

### example_positions.txt
A text document containing chess positions in Forsythâ€“Edwards Notation (FEN) sorted by a meaning for testing. E.g. Positions with an obvious best move, Positions where black gets checkmated, etc.

## Reading order of the notebooks
To understand this project you will need to read the content of the notebooks. This section will give you a logical order in which the notebooks can be read.

To begin with you will need to make yourself familiar with the `Chess.jl` library, which will be heavily used during the whole project.
