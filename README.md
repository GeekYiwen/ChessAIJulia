The notebooks ending on `[notebook]_testing.ipynb` are tests for the corresponding notebook.

### /Games
This directory contains PGN (Portable Game Notation) files of chess games played against written AIs in the `Play.ipynb`. They will be saved to later on find errors to see how the chess AIs behaved.

### example_positions.txt
A text document containing chess positions in Forsythâ€“Edwards Notation (FEN) sorted by a meaning for testing. E.g. Positions with an obvious best move, Positions where black gets checkmated, etc.

## Reading order of the notebooks
To understand this project you will need to read the content of the notebooks. This section will give you a logical order in which the notebooks can be read.

To begin with, you will need to make yourself familiar with the `Chess.jl` library, which will be heavily used during the whole project. To get an overview of all important functions of the `Chess.jl` library you can read the `ChessJL Summary.ipynb` as well as [the official documentation of Chess.jl](https://romstad.github.io/Chess.jl/dev/).

After this you should be reading into the `EvaluatePosition.ipynb` which implements a functions to evaluate/estimate a chess position without calculating any moves into the future. This is our heuristic function ([Simplified Evaluation function](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Simplified_Evaluation_Function)) and is based on the article of Tomasz Michniewski.

After this you can read into the different AIs. The simplest AI is the Random Move AI which is implemented in the `Random Chess.ipynb` notebook. The next step is the `Minimax` Algorithm implemented in the `Minimax.ipynb` notebook. The Minimax Algorithm can be improved by using Alpha-Beta-Pruning. This is implemented in the `AlphaBetaPruning.ipynb`. Lastly, Alpha-Beta-Pruning can be improved using the `Iterative Deepening` strategy which is implemented in the `IterativeDeepening.ipynb` notebook.

The reading order of the AIs therefore should be: `Random Chess.ipynb` > `Minimax.ipynb` > `AlphaBetaPruning.ipynb` > `IterativeDeepening.ipynb`

The topic of `Memoization` is implemented in each of the AI notebooks individually. To further understand Memoization a Hashing function is needed. Therefore we use `Zobrist Hashing` implemented in `ZobristHashing.ipynb`. This notebook can be read at any time as this will not effect the understanding of the AI Algorithms.

To play with an AI you can use the `Play.ipynb` notebook. The Play.ipynb uses three notebooks which contain helpng functions included in the `ValidateUserInput.ipynb`, `PGN_Export.ipynb` and `PGN_Import.ipynb`.
