    "To detect a draw by repetition we associate a Dictionary repCounter with a `Board`. The dictionary pairs boards represented by their hash with the number of times the board has been reached in the game. Therefore the type of the Dictionary is `Dict{UInt64, Int8}()`. Each time a move is made the new board gets stored into the Dictionary with the value of one. If the board has already been stored the counter of this hash will increase by 1. If at any point a hash has the value of 3 a threefold repetition has occured and the game automatically results in a draw. \n"
