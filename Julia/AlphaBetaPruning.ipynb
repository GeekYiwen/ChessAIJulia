    "The Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm works by recursively evaluating nodes\n",
    "in a game tree. The Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm can be described as an improved version\n",
    "of the MiniMax algorithm. The MiniMax algorithm evaluates all possible\n",
    "game outcomes to find the best move for a player, which is describe in Notebook MiniMax. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, this algorithm works by maintaining two values, alpha and beta, which\n",
    "represent the best possible score that the maximizing player can achieve\n",
    "and the best possible score that the minimizing player can achieve,\n",
    "respectively. By comparing these values with previously evaluated nodes,\n",
    "alpha-beta pruning can determine which branches of the tree can be\n",
    "pruned without affecting the final result. So it is possible to prune\n",
    "branches that cannot lead to a better outcome. This reduces the search\n",
    "space, resulting in faster computation times and allowing the algorithm\n",
    "to search deeper into the game tree. A comprehensive validation of this technique is presented in the work of Donald E. Knuth and Ronald W. Moore \\cite{Knuth1975}, which provides further insight into the effectiveness of this algorithm."
